# System Design Studio 2023: Team Grabies Code

Our Agent-based Model is built on React, JavaScript and HTML.

Steps to launch our code:

1. `git pull` this repo
2. Navigate to this project directory and run `npm install` to download all the requirements
3. `npm start` to launch our app!

After generating your JSON outputs, you can navigate to `analytics` folder which houses `calculations.ipynb` python source code, and put the JSON in the `data/single_agent` folder (examples have already been put in place as well as the proper naming scheme)
